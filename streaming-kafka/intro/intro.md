## Using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Streaming with Apache Kafka

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Streaming can replace an Apache Kafka installation. 
This is a managed service. No installation, patching, upgrade or hosting. All is done for you.

Streaming is compatible with most Kafka APIs, allowing you to use applications written for Kafka to send messages to and receive messages from the Streaming service without having to rewrite your code. See Using Kafka APIs for more information.

You can use Streaming for replacing your own Kafka cluster and use this Managed Service instead.
